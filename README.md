# Text to Speech Video Sample

This is the sample project from my Text-to-Speech tutorial on YouTube. The included dictionary is from the Carnegie Mellon University Computer Science Department, although I removed a version of "deja" that contained non-ASCII characters which would raise an error (There is a way to properly handle it though). Additionally, not all the speech sounds have been included.

US English speakers, this is your opportunity to be your own TTS so try recording your own sounds!
